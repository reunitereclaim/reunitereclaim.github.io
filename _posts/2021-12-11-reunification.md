![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/free15v2.png)


It is time for all mandates and restrictions to go!
Do not let the government delay the full opening up of society any longer! 

Dec 2nd was promised - then postponed.
Dec 15 is allocated and this must be adhered to!
Will we no longer put up with the ever elusive carrot of freedoms the government promises to return to us.

Too many are suffering from exclusion, closed businesses, shortages and disruption.

On the 15th we say enough is enough. Remove any qr code. Take off you mask.  End the vaccine divide.  Reunify

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/free15v2.png)

Can you remember when you could blow out candles on a birthday cake,  sing in a church or travel to a friends house with out the risk of jail time. 

Remember when we used to hug and kiss,  shake hands,  remember when we didn't care about someone's medical status. 

We can go back to that, and we will,  on December 15


It is time for all mandates and restrictions to go!
Do not let the government delay the full opening up of society any longer! 

Dec 2nd was promised - then postponed.
Dec 15 is allocated and this must be adhered to!
Will we no longer put up with the ever elusive carrot of freedoms the government promises to return to us.

Too many are suffering from exclusion, closed businesses, shortages and disruption.

On the 15th we say enough is enough. Remove any qr code. Take off you mask.  End the vaccine divide.  Reunify

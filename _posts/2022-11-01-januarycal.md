### TAP January Calendar of Events

Hey everyone, as we emerge from a break, we look forward to seeing you at our upcoming local events. A focus for TAP Coffs Harbour Region is developing strong community networks and taking meaningful action, so we can support each other to be resilient and weather any storms that come our way, and have some fun together! 

Reclaim the Line is happening on Saturday 15th January at the Jetty, so come along to support freedom of choice, and let's make this inspiring event even bigger than last time!  

The following week, on Saturday 22nd of January we will be having a big community TAP gathering, also at the Jetty. Come along to connect with wonderful people in our community, find out what’s been happening in our different focus groups, grab a BBQ lunch fundraiser, and see how you can get involved in fun and meaningful actions. 

On the last weekend in January (29th or 30th), we will have our next Agora market. This is a fun and uplifting buy-swap-sell market, a chance to get together and bring your goodies, set up a free stall or rack, even your car boot, make some money, do some trades, get some yummy food and have great conversations. This is a way to keep our resources and money circulating within our community so we are less reliant on outside forces, and can support each other in practical ways. 

Technology Liberation - by Barking Bandicoot

A presentation on various aspect of technology liberation and an open discussion about: What operating system is best? What VPN should you choose? What email service is best? Can I encrypt my email? What about anonymous email? Which password manager? What do I replace Google drive with? What is 'Open Source Software' and why choose it?

Thank you for being part of our community that is growing every day. We would also love to hear from you about what you see needs to happen in our community. Do you have an idea, or something to contribute? How often would you like to meet up? Let us know, because we’re all in this together, and your voice matters.
